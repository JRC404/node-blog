# Node.js blog

I have been thinking about what I can do with this blog and I haven't actually created a blog post yet. So, I may end up doing so shortly. 

Development is slower than when it first started as I have been diving into C# and iOS a bit more but the next thing for this project is to create a user profile. I am debating whether to use JWT or sessions... 

## Things to do

- [x] Express server
- [x] Template for styling (HBS)
