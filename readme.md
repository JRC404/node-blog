# Node.js blog

Furthering my development with Node.js, I'll be creating a blog. It's something that I have wanted to do for a while and my aim is to have it complete (when is a project really, truly complete.) by the end of April, 2020. 

## Development

I will be using Node, Express and MongoDB for this project. 

## Things to do 

- [ ] Express server
- [ ] Template for styling (EJS)
- [ ] MongoDB setup
- [ ] Documentation / Comments / Wiki
- [ ] Research into deployment
