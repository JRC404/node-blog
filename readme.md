# Node.js blog

Furthering my development with Node.js, I'll be creating a blog. It's something that I have wanted to do for a while and my aim is to have it complete (when is a project really, truly complete.) by the end of April, 2020.

## Development

I will be using Node, Express and MongoDB for this project.

## Things to do

- [x] Express server
- [x] Template for styling (HBS)
- [x] MongoDB setup
- [x] Research into deployment - Heroku
- [x] GET - posts, edit etc
- [x] POST - post updates, deletes
- [x] Timestamps for posts
- [x] Controllers
- [ ] Routes
- [ ] Comments
- [ ] Documentation / Comments / Wiki
- [ ] Sessions for sign in
- [ ] Research into safe deployment. You've done deployment, Jacob. Now, do it safely.
